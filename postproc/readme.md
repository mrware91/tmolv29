## Summary
Scripts for analyzing the H5 data generated by the preprocessing code.

### H5Reader.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates reading in the H5 structure which will be used in tmolw56.
Namely, the fast detectors will sit in the root directory, `/`, while the epics and summary variables will sit in `/summary` and `/epics` respecitvely.

Sample data can be found at `/cds/home/m/mrware/Share/tmolw56`.
